### How It Works

1. **Book Fetching**:

   - Enter a Project Gutenberg book ID
   - The app fetches raw text content from Gutenberg's API
   - First 6,000 characters are processed

> Due to the constraints of Groq's free tier, only the first 6,000 characters of the book are processed. This allows for a quick demonstration of the application's capabilities while keeping API usage within the free limits.

2. **LLM Analysis**:

   - Content is sent to Groq's `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`

> The `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` model was chosen for its balance between performance and cost within Groq's free tier. It provides high accuracy in character identification and sentiment analysis without compromising application speed.

- The LLM identifies:
  - All major characters
  - Their relationships/interactions
  - Key quotes per character
  - Sentiment analysis for each interaction

3. **Data Processing**:

   - Interactions are counted and weighted
   - Characters are ranked by importance
   - Sentiment scores are normalized (-1 to 1 scale)

4. **Visualization**:
   - React Flow displays characters as nodes
   - Edges show interactions
   - Color-coded sentiment analysis
